    <h2>New York City</h2>
    <p> <i>New York, often called New York City (NYC) to distinguish it from the State of New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. </i></p>

    <h2>! Tourist Attractions !</h2>
    <p> 
        <h3>1) Statue of Liberty</h3>
        <p> America's most iconic sight, the Statue of Liberty is at the top of every first-time visitor's list of things to do in New York. 
            It was France's gift to America. Built in 1886, it remains a world symbol of freedom and is one of the top attractions in America. 
            You can see the statue from land, with particularly good views from Battery Park, on the southern tip of Manhattan. 
            However, to truly appreciate the Statue of Liberty, the best thing to do is to take a short boat trip to Liberty Island and see it up close. 
            Take a pleasant stroll around the base, and if you have reservations, enter the pedestal. The crown remains closed as of writing.</p>

        <h3>2) Central Park</h3>
        <p> A walk, peddle, or carriage ride through the crisscrossing pathways of Central Park is a must-do on anyone's New York City itinerary. 
            In winter, you can even lace up your skates and glide across Wollman Rink. 
            This huge park in the city center, a half-mile wide and 2.5 miles long, is one of the things that makes New York such a beautiful and livable city.</p>

        <h3>3) Metropolitan Museum of Art</h3>
        <p> The Metropolitan Museum of Art, or the Met, as it is commonly known, was founded in 1870, and is one of the most famous museums in the United States. 
            The permanent collection of The Met contains more than two million works of art, spanning a period of 5,000 years.
            Although the museum has three sites, the centerpiece is The Met Fifth Avenue. 
            Highlights of the collection include American decorative arts, arms and armor, costumes, Egyptian art, musical instruments, photographs, and much more.</p>

        <h3>4) Broadway</h3>
        <p> Attending a Broadway show is one of the top things to do in New York City. Considered the pinnacle of American theater, this is the place to see the latest shows and the long-running classics.
            Broadway usually refers simply to Broadway theater, which encompasses a large number of theater venues in the Theater District and along the street of Broadway. 
            For the most popular shows, tickets should be purchased well in advance.</p>

        <h3>5) The Empire State Building</h3>
        <p> The Empire State Building is one of New York's most famous landmark buildings and key tourist attractions. 
            The 381-meter-tall, 102-storey building was the tallest in the world until the 1 World Trade Center tower rose higher, 41 years later. 
            Topped with a mooring mast for airships, the Empire State Building immediately became a landmark and a symbol for NYC when it opened in 1931.
            There are actually two observatories atop the Empire State Building, but both offer astounding views. On clear days, you can see up to 80 miles, looking into the neighboring states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.</p>

    <h2> Best "Máxima Calidad" Restaurants for Dinner</h2>
    <p>
        <h3 style="color: black" >1) Crown Shy</h3>
        <p> What is it? This 2019 opening was longtime chef de cuisine at Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park James Kent's first solo venture. 
            Crown Shy still turns out excellent food and beautiful cocktails in an elegant environment that's equal parts special occasion destination and nicer-than-normal evening whim. 
            Its upstairs neighbor Overstory is also sensational for drinks with a view after dinner.</p>

        <h3 style="color:black"> 2) Dhamaka </h3>
        <p> The unstoppable Unapologetic Foods team spotlights what they refer to as “the forgotten side of India,” including gurda kapoora 
            (goat kidney, testicles, red onion and pao) doh khleh (pork with lime, cilantro, onion and ginger) and champaran meat (mutton, garlic, red chili). 
            The group has continued opening new venues since Dhamaka, including Rowdy Rooster, which serves the best new fried chicken sandwich in NYC. </p>

        <h3 style="color:black"> 3) Gage & Tollner </h3>
        <p> Long the stuff of legend, Gage & Tollner had a previous iteration as one of Brooklyn's most glittering restaurants before its gilded space ceased operation in 2004 after more than a century. 
            A trio of Brooklyn hospitality pros got to work reviving it a baker's dozen years later and, after a pause in 2020, Gage & Tollner is finally open for business once more. </p>
        <img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/105775049/1372/1029/image.jpg" style="width:500px;height:600px">

        <h3 style="color:black"> 4) Rezdôra  </h3>
        <p> After a turn at Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, which was ranked 2018's best restaurant in the world, chef Stefano Secchi went on to open one of NYC's best restaurants the following year. 
            Rezdôra serves a comprehensive complement of pasta options prepared with the highest quality ingredients.
            Dinner at Rezdôra feels like a new culinary experience even for people who grew up on pasta night. 
            Individual plates are available, but its $95 regional pasta tasting is an exciting tour of the restaurant's best.</p>

        <h3 style="color:black"> 5) Olmsted  </h3>
        <p> Olmstead's expertly authored and executed menu has always had apparent notes of fine dining at lower prices, which presently max out at $38 for a za'atar smoked duck breast. 
            These last remaining days of summer also happen to be a prime time to time to enjoy Olmsted's garden. </p>
